                </div>
                <p class="text-lg border-t border-white mt-4 pt-4">A landing page is a specific webpage created with a
                    singular purpose in mind. It is designed to fulfill a
                    specific goal, such as sharing news or promoting a product or service. In essence, a landing page is
                    built to answer a particular need or question that a potential customer or user may have.

                    Landing pages are often used for marketing campaigns and selling products or services. They are
                    sometimes also referred to as "sale pages" because of their primary purpose in generating leads or
                    driving sales.

                    To create an effective landing page, several components must be considered, such as the layout, content,
                    and call-to-action. It is also important to continually test and refine the landing page to optimize its
                    effectiveness.

                    As a developer, I would create a landing page using Nuxt 3 and various JavaScript libraries, and deploy
                    it on Netlify to ensure the most efficient server-to-user response time.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-3xl font-medium">What is Multi-page?</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="text-lg border-t border-white mt-4 pt-4">Multi Page refers to the website structure designed in
                    sections separated by their respective page functions, such as index, login, dashboard, etc. When the
                    path changes, the server renders new data and displays it.

                    Multi Page is often used for marketing campaigns and selling products or services. Sometimes they are
                    also called "sales pages" because the main purpose is to create opportunities for sales or boost sales,
                    similar to single pages. However, Multi Page differs as it has multiple pages to display more in-depth
                    information, and because of this, it takes longer to develop than landing pages.

                    To create an efficient Multi Page, several elements need to be considered, such as layout, content, and
                    call-to-actions. It is crucial to continuously test and adjust the Landing Page to improve its
                    performance.

                    As a developer, I will create a Multi Page using Nuxt 3 and various JavaScript libraries, and deploy it
                    on Netlify to ensure the most efficient server-to-user responsiveness.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-3xl font-medium">What is Web Application?</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="text-lg border-t border-white mt-4 pt-4">A web application is an app that is written to be
                    directly accessed through a web browser without the need to download a full-fledged application onto a
                    device. As a result, it generally consumes relatively low resources, can be quickly accessed, and is
                    typically optimized to run faster than a regular app. This makes the interface friendly and
                    user-friendly. Nowadays, there are various web applications available, from global to university-level
                    to corporate-level applications.

                    Web applications function similarly to websites but can also function as applications. They emphasize on
                    users "using" rather than just viewing, such as a web app for calculating, timing, or translating, which
                    are usually cleaner, faster, and more comfortable to use than regular websites due to their focus on one
                    specific feature.

                    For development, I will be using Nuxt 3 and various JavaScript libraries for front-end development. I
                    will use Golang for back-end development, PostgreSQL for the database, and Netlify for project
                    deployment.</p>
